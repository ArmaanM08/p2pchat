I'll guide you through setting up and using the secure chat application in simple steps:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Setup
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (Python 3.7 or newer)
2. Create a new folder called `secure-chat` on your computer

### Step 2: Create the Files
1. Inside the `secure-chat` folder, create these four files:
   - `server.py`
   - `client.py`
   - `config.py`
   - `README.md`
2. Copy and paste the code I provided earlier into each corresponding file

### Step 3: Generate SSL Certificates
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
2. Navigate to your `secure-chat` folder
3. Run this command to generate security certificates:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
```
4. When prompted, you can press Enter for most fields (they're optional for testing)

### Step 4: Configure the Application
1. Open `config.py` in a text editor
2. Change these settings:
   - For local testing (same computer or network):
     - Leave `HOST` as '0.0.0.0'
     - Set `CLIENT_HOST` to '127.0.0.1'
   - For internet use:
     - Leave `HOST` as '0.0.0.0'
     - Set `CLIENT_HOST` to your server's public IP address
   - Change `PASSWORD` to your desired password

### Step 5: Setting Up the Server
1. If you want to use it over the internet:
   - Host the server on a computer with a public IP address
   - Configure your router to forward port 55555 to your server
   - Make sure your firewall allows connections on port 55555
2. If using locally, no additional setup is needed

### Step 6: Running the Application
1. Start the server:
   - Open Command Prompt/Terminal
   - Navigate to the `secure-chat` folder
   - Run: `python server.py`
   - You should see: "Server is running..."

2. Start the clients (on two different computers or two different windows):
   - Open Command Prompt/Terminal
   - Navigate to the `secure-chat` folder
   - Run: `python client.py`
   - A chat window will appear

### Step 7: Using the Chat
1. When both clients connect, you'll see "Chat can begin now!"
2. Type your message in the text box at the bottom
3. Click "Send" or press Enter to send the message
4. Messages will appear in both chat windows
5. To quit, click the X button on the window

### Troubleshooting Common Issues:

1. If clients can't connect:
   - Make sure the server is running
   - Verify the IP address in `config.py` is correct
   - Check if firewall is blocking the connection
   - Verify the password matches in `config.py`

2. If you get SSL errors:
   - Make sure `server.crt` and `server.key` files are in the same folder
   - Try generating the SSL certificates again

3. If the GUI doesn't appear:
   - Make sure Python is installed correctly
   - Verify tkinter is installed (it comes with Python normally)

### Important Notes:
- Don't share your password with untrusted people
- Keep your SSL certificate files secure
- The chat only works with exactly two people
- Messages are not saved when you close the program

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
